## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository (or use GitHub Desktop using the URL):**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Raiyan-S/GP_Dashboard.git
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    Python ver 3.11
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    
    If powershell policy preventing scripts:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

4. **Install the required dependencies for backend (if missing):**

    ```sh
    cd Back-End
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Run the backend server:**

    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```
6. **Open the Project in Your Browser:** Go to: http://localhost:8000/
